Export keys on your system:Export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_IDExport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYImported these keys into /etc/profile on my Mac so they will be available for use without sending it out via yml playbook.I created two playbook in Ansible:- createservers.yml - creates Instances in AWS in my VPC and assigned the right security group.- configserver.yml - installs software and configures the system.After running the first yml to create the instances, then the public IP of the instance needs to be copied into the hosts file prior to running the configserver.ymlansible-playbook -i hosts configserver.yml
